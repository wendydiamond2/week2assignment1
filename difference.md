| Webpages were largely static and connected through hyperlinks. Frames and tables are used to position and align the elements on a page. The content largely comprised the written word but also featured GIFs. No support for viewer interaction. | By users: This form of the web relies on user-generated content. For users: The fact that much of the content is user-generated ensures user access to a much larger pool of information, ease of use, and compatibility with other systems and devices. So much so that today, Web2.0 has become all about the user experience. It features videos, graphics, a lot of colors, and animations too. | Open: That means everyone has equal access to the web, and there are mechanisms to ensure that every person can contribute to decision-making. Trustless: It operates based on incentives and economic mechanisms. Decentralized: It isn't controlled by third parties, such as tech giants, and central entities do not own it. |
